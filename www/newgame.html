<div hidden id="UN">
  <p>
    After the outbreak of hostilities with Mars more than 80 years ago and the
    treaties that followed, the UN assumed the role of the unified sovereign
    government over the Earth, Moon, and Mercury. Known for its glacial
    bureaucracy and stodgy leaders, Earth remains an economic powerhouse,
    largly as a result of remaining the sole inhabitable body in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the fragile treaty after the War of Martian Independence, the UN
    member nations continue to see Mars as selfish and ungrateful.
  </p>
</div>

<div hidden id="MC">
  <p>
    Nearly 50 years after its founding as a science outpost in the early 22nd
    century, Mars declared independence from an Earth that it increasingly
    viewed as a distant, intrusive micromanager. In the 84 years since its
    founding, Mars has grown into a military power rivaling Earth, with a
    thriving economy and highly educated populace. Since its independence, Mars
    has focused its significant resources toward the scientific and
    technological achievements necessary to realize its population's dream of a
    "Green Mars".
  </p>
  <p>
    The Martian Commonwealth controls Mars and its moons as well as the Jovian
    system, providing the infrastructure and resource to maintain and grow the
    domed habitats of Jupiter's moons, whose proximity to the gas giant makes
    them the bread basket of the outer planets.
  </p>
</div>

<div hidden id="TRANSA">
  <p>
    Those who live in the outer planets are exquisitely aware of the fragile
    existence they lead, completely dependent on shipments of food, water,
    medicine, and technology from the inner planets in order to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Mars broke from Earth, deliveries to the furthest installations on
    Pluto and Triton ceased in the face of privateering and the realities of a
    war economy. Those who survived the food riots shortly found themselves
    under the unforgiving, magnetic boot of a coalition of thugs and vigilante
    gangs collectively calling themselves the Trans-Neptunian Authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    With resources stretched and hungry mouths to feed, TRANSA offers the
    lowest tax rates in the system, promising a hefty margin to any traders
    willing to make the "Long Haul", as it is popularly known. Given the
    limited number of warships available to the SPC and the vast volume of
    space its member systems cover, making the Long Haul can as be perilous as
    it is profitable.
  </p>
</div>

<div hidden id="CERES">
  <p>
    Holding a favorable position orbiting within the asteroid belt, Ceres has
    long served as a center of trade between the inner and outer planets. Its
    location also serves to make it a launching point for mining operations
    within the asteroid belt.
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of shipyards have grown up around Ceres, taking advantage of the
    central location and ease of access to materials to make Ceres the primary
    ship-bulding center in the system.
  </p>
</div>

<div hidden id="ICS">
  <p>
    Faced with the same economic constraints and pressures as the outer planets
    during the war but with much closer and more powerful corporate interests
    at hand, the Saturnian moons controlling interests joined to form the
    Interplanetary Commercial Syndicate. Funded by some of the richest
    corporations on Earth, the ICS has become a force unto itself, patrolling
    the outer planets' trade routes with its corporate fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Life in the domes of Saturn is difficult, and the harvesting of ice and ore
    in the outer system is dangerous work, but citizen employees can rest
    assured that the Board of Directors has their best interests at heart, or
    at least their compound interest at heart, as many are bound by contract or
    debt to their Syndicate.
  </p>
</div>
